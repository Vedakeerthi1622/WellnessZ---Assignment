Nodejs Task
Make a Rest API using Nodejs + SQL
API requirements are as follows:
1. Make a model of Posts (with fields: title, desc, tag, image...)
2. Create an endpoint to get all posts and it should be configured with
the following options:
• An Option to sort, and paginate the data
• An Option keyword that filters the posts that contains that
keyword either in the title or description
• An Option Tag that gives us the posts associated with that
particular tag.
3. Create an endpoint that Inserts a POST in the posts collection.
• Upload the image to cloud services (AWS S3, Cloudinary or others...)
Other requirements are -
● If possible, deploy the solution into production.
● The code should be clean and maintainable.
● Share the POSTMAN collection of the same with examples attached to each api(s)
